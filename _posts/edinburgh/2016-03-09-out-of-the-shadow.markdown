There's an exhibit at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery entitled ["Out of the Shadow: Women of Nineteenth Century Scotland"](https://www.nationalgalleries.org/visit/scottish-national-portrait-gallery-23553/room-displays/out-of-the-shadow-women-of-nineteenth-century-scotland) that features portraits of women of the period and descriptions of their achievements. The exhibit includes quotes by men about women, including this one by John Knox, author of *The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women*:

> "To promote a Woman to beare rule, superioritie, dominion, or empire above any Realme, Nation or
> Citie, is...a subversion of good Order, of all equitie and justice."
