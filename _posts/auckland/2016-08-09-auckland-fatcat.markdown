This is a [working, sustainable vegan farm](http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Fat-Cat-Travellers-Community/Auckland/59212#propname) you can spend the night (or a week) on. They have "solar showers, a fire bath, chickens, compost systems, a bicycle-powered washing machine and beautiful gardens full of organic fruits and vegetables."
