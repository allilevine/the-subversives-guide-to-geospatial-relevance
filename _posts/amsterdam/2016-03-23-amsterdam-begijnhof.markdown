The Begijnhof is a former beguinage, [a community of socially and economically independent women](https://penguinunearthed.wordpress.com/2011/03/11/travelling-feminist-beguines/) who shared a religious faith and did good works, but preferred not to live in a convent. This beguinage dates from the late 14th century but was rebuilt in the 17th and 18th centuries. It doesn't currently have a religious affiliation and The Begijnhof Foundation rents out the homes to the 93 women who live there.
